# Hotel Booking Data Analysis and Visualization
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and visualization project on hotel booking data. The project aims to explore and gain insights from the dataset, and effectively present the findings through interactive visualizations using Python and Tableau.

Project Overview
The project focuses on understanding various aspects of hotel bookings and uncovering key patterns and trends. It includes the following components:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The dataset is thoroughly examined to identify trends, patterns, and factors influencing reservation cancellations, optimal stay lengths, revenue contribution from different booking channels, and more. Data cleaning, feature engineering, and statistical analysis are performed to derive meaningful insights.

Interactive Dashboard: An interactive dashboard is developed using Tableau to effectively communicate the findings. The dashboard showcases essential Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), such as cancellation rate, average lead time, occupancy rate, customer type distribution, and average daily rate (ADR). Users can explore the data from various dimensions and perspectives through the interactive visualizations.
